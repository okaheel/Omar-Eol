<br />

<br />
Phytoplankton, along with algae that grow attached to sea ice, are the conduit of the sun's energy into organic &quot;food&quot; at the base of the food chain in the Chukchi Sea. Phytoplankton are assessed as chlorophyll-a concentration from water samples collected with a Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) rosette. We also measure the concentration of the major nutrients required for their growth in these samples. Zooplankton are the major consumers of phytoplankton, and hence the key pathway to vertebrates such as pelagic fish, seabirds, and even bowhead whales. Zooplankton are collected using two different methods: paired ring nets of medium-size mesh hauled vertically at slow speed for smaller species, and Bongo nets towed off the side of a ship moving at 2 knots for larger, faster species. This dataset is part of the Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (PacMARS) Project.

Water column profile data were collected using a submarine-launched conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probe. Probe depths were computed based on a known fall rate, temperature (T) and conductivity values were measured by probe sensors, and salinity was computed from these values. Derived variables, including pressure (calculated from depth and latitude), potential temperature, sigma-t (a representation of density), and sigma-theta (sigma-t calculated with potential temperature), are also included.</p> 
<p>Profile data were generally collected to a depth of 1000 m at 1-m depth intervals, with variable horizontal distance between the profiles.

From the perspective of many hunters and elders in the Arctic, the weather has been uggianaqtuq in recent years. Inuit from two communities in Nunavut, Canada (Baker Lake and Clyde River), share their observations and perspectives on recent environmental changes. The CD-ROM is a pilot project that uses media technology, as opposed to written reports, as an alternative way to document and communicate Inuit observations and knowledge. It is a research product/report for the communities involved, as well as others interested in how Inuit are experiencing environmental change. Maps, text, photos, video and music are integrated to help illustrate the changes Inuit have observed in their environment and the impacts on their livelihoods. The integrated components allow the user to</p> 
<p>* search by topic or the person being interviewed</p> 
<p>* view interview clips in Inuktitut with English interpretations</p> 
<p>* view and print maps about environmental changes drawn by participants</p>

Starting about 1990, many stations in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Canada closed. Canada is also seeing a trend toward automation. In recognition, we are providing updated fields using statistical techniques. This reconstruction technique has also been used to compile fields back to 1980 to provide a period of overlap with gridded fields based on interpolation of monthly station precipitation and daily disaggregation (see DAILY PRECIPITATION, FROM MONTHLY STATION RECORDS AND DISAGGREGATION). The reconstructions employ a four-step approach. As part of the data processing of ArcticRIMS (http://RIMS.unh.edu) based at the Water Systems Analysis Group, University of New Hampshire all data sets have been aggregated to multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.</p>

For best results, only order one day of data in one data request, since the data files are large.</span></p>",NULL,"2015-08-01 00:00:00","2015-08-31 23:59:59",10.00000,-140.00000,40.00000,-45.00000,grid,28,1,1,NULL,final,4862,123,1,171,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,1,2261,"2017-11-20 16:27:27",708,"2018-05-02 15:28:47"

The objective was to photo document the evolution and structure of the hook region within the supercell. Data were collected by two teams, CAMA and CAMB, during 2009 and three teams, CAMA, CAMB and CAMC, during 2010. Each team was comprised of a photographer and videographer. The teams attempted to collocate with the mobile X-band Doppler radars. For most missions, CAMA, CAMB and CAMC collocated with DOW7, DOW6 and DOW5, respectively. This data set contains only the data collected by team CAMB. Several types of data are contained in this data set including: data digital still imagery (DSLR), HD video, QuickTime movies, panoramas, damage surveys, Google Earth KMZ files, and mission summaries.

Before the year 2000, most, if not all, data on flying birds were recorded continuously, which can result in an inflated number of birds recorded per unit area. After 2000, most flying birds were recorded with the snap-shot method. The data in this dataset were retrieved from the USGS maintained North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database, version 2, which is expected to be on line by late 2014, which have not been adjusted for the change in recording methods.

10369,106.438,"History of the Arctic Flora in North America","<p>This dataset in an attempt to increase understanding of how climate cycles of the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years) impacted divergence in Arctic and alpine tundra flora. Specimens were collected in Beringia and the mountains of western North America, focusing on populations existing within (western and eastern Beringia, and the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, respectively), as well as sites between those refugia. Briefly, DNA was sequenced from chloroplast and nuclear loci for multiple species of tundra plants that inhabited the entire study region. Target species (Campanula species, Kobresia myosuroides, Lloydia serotina, Pinguicula vulgaris, Poa alpina, Rhodiola species, and Saxifraga species) were phylogenetically diverse and displayed a range of dispersal abilities, making them excellent candidates for evaluating general history of the tundra. Those genetic data make up this Arctic Flora dataset. From the genetic sequence data, gene trees are being reconstructed and used to estimate the patterns and timing of divergence, test which geologic and climatic events most impacted divergence, and infer how the process of genetic divergence differed between Arctic and alpine tundra refugia.

The data is archived in nexus files - the standard format for aligned sequence data ready to be used in a phylogenetic analysis. The files are separated by taxon and genetic locus within a given taxon. The nexus format provides details on the data type (DNA), number of samples, and length of sequence. Within a file, all the sequences are aligned but not interleaved, such that the 'sample name' is followed by the entire sequence for that sample. All the specimens that were collected are archived and publicly accessible in the Western Washington University Herbarium.</p>",NULL,"2007-01-01 00:00:00","2012-12-31 23:59:59",35.00000,-179.00000,75.00000,-100.00000,NULL,2,1,1,NULL,NULL,1920,123,1019,149,NULL,0714232,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,1,864,"2013-03-01 16:07:37",2240,"2018-05-25 17:52:01"

A prototype, real-time, hourly, multi-sensor National Preciptation Analysis (NPA) has been developed at NCEP in cooperation with the Office of Hydrology (OH). This analysis merges two data sources that are currently being collected in real-time by OH and NCEP. Hourly digital precipitation (HDP) radar estimates are created by the WSR-88D Radar Product Generator on a 131 X 131 4-km grid centered over each radar site. Data analysis routines, including a bias correction of the radar estimates using rain gage data, have been adapted by NCEP on a national 4-km grid from algorithms developed by OH and executed regionally at NWS River Forecast Centers (RFC). This dataset only contains the NCEP 4 KM GRIB Data hourly, 6-hourly, and daily radar estimate (no bias removal). 6-hourly data are generally available at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z. Daily data are generally available at 12Z. Depending on the time period selected, all three datasets may or may not be available. Other NCEP 4 KM GRIB Data including gage-only analysis, multi-sensor analysis (gage and unbiased radar), radar estimate after bias removal, and gage-only analysis using 24h accumulated ("RFC") data are available as independent datasets. Depending on the time period selected, all five types may or may not be available. Please see GCIP/EOP: Surface NCEP Ancillary Catalogue of Available GCIP Precipitation Data (NCEP/EMC). The format of the files is GRIB. The files are compressed using the UNIX "compress" command and "uncompress" must be used before decoding. This dataset is provided as is and was not quality controlled by UCAR/JOSS. Beginning 1 Jan 2002, the analysis grid has been changed to conform with the official NWS HRAP grid.
