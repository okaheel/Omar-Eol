Lipofuscin includes a mixture of protein oxidation products formed in neural tissues. The extracted products are quantified using a fluorescence detector. The concentration of lipofuscin is normalized to the protein content from the same tissues. The ratio of lipofuscin to protein concentration is the Lipofuscin Index and is calculated for each individual organisms. In order for the index to reflect chronological age, a calibration is required using euphausiids of known age. A comparison of the calculated ages to the specific lengths for each krill provides the ages for those krill analyzed during each cruise. These data are preliminary until an age calibration curve is completed following rearing. These data were collected aboard the United States Coast Guard Icebreaker Healy.

The tethered system is comprised of up to eight NCAR designed and built sensor platforms using the Vaisala RS-90 P, T and RH sensor package for these measurements. Wind speed comes from an R.M. Young propellor using an optical chopper. Wind direction comes from a Honeywell magnetometer which provides pitch and roll information in addition to direction. The sensor packages are tethered to a large balloon, and are spaced apart at various altitudes along a line attached to the balloon. Each transmits one second resolution data simultaneously over a period of time.
